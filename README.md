# Flux Client

A modular, in-page control panel that can be toggled on any website (with a few excluded domains). It unlocks a variety of utilities, “mods,” fun effects, and scripting tools—all accessible through an animated, draggable interface. A small access screen requiring the key `UPDATE` precedes the full menu. Once unlocked, the main interface appears with smooth fade-and-scale animations, a customizable color scheme, and a collapsible sidebar for navigating between sections.
